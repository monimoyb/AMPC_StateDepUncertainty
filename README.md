# A Semi-Definite Programming Approach to Robust Adaptive MPC under State Dependent Uncertainty

These set of codes replicate the results of the paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9143777. A computationally efficient SDP based algorithm is presented for robust MPC design under state dependent additive uncertainties.
